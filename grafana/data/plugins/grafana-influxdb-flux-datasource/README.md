# InfluxDB (Flux) Datasource [BETA]

This plugin will work with InfluxDB 2.x and InfluxDB 1.8+

In a future grafana releases, this plugin will be incorporated into the main influx plugin and allow a single datasource to support flux queries or influxql (SQL style) queries.

## Using
The plugin contains a monaco editor as the query editor which you can copy/paste flux queries into. 
For now, there are a number of flux queries templated in the query editor that you can use as examples.

For a more graphical experience, your data explorer will be available at:
`<url specified in config editor>/orgs/<org-id>/data-explorer`

### Finding your flux org id
In order to find the proper URL, you will ned to get your org-id. This can be done using a query similar to below:

https://influxdb.company.com:9999/api/v2/orgs

Embedded in this JSON response, you will find an array of all organizations, with two fields (shown below)

```
  "id": "059b46a59abab000",
  "name": "grafana",
```

Look for the `name` specified as your default bucket, and you can use the cooresponding id if the `id` field.

So, if I entered in the config editor, my url to influxdb as `https://influxdb.company.com:9999`, your data-explorer url would be `https://influxdb.company.com:9999/orgs/059b46a59abab000/data-explorer`.

In the influx data explorer, you have a graphical query editor you may use. Hit the "Script Editor" button to go to flux langage mode, copy your request, and paste it into the influx query editor.
